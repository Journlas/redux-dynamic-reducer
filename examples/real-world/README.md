# Real World Example

This example extends [Redux's Real World example](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/tree/master/examples/real-world) to create many of the components as isolated redux component.

To run the example locally:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ioof-holdings/redux-dynamic-reducer.git

cd redux-dynamic-reducer/examples/real-world
npm install
npm start
```

Or check out the [sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/ioof-holdings/redux-dynamic-reducer/tree/master/examples/real-world).
